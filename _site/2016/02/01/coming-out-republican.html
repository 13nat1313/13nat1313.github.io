<p class="p2"><span class="s2">By Sugarcakes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">LHS sophomore Lloyd Fredricksen always knew he was a little bit different.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">“When other kids would be, like, playing games and stuff, I’d be redrawing congressional districts in order to have a more conservative constituency per district,” he said in an exclusive interview with The Muskeeto last Tuesday. “So, yeah, I guess you could say that I knew from a very young age that I was a Republican.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Fredricksen has recently joined the ranks of several other LHS students to “come out of the voting booth” as Republican Party supporters, now increasing the total number of Republicans at LHS to exactly three.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">“It’s hard to come to terms with your identity,” Fredricksen said, “But with so much in the media encouraging people to ‘dare to be themselves’ and stuff, I thought ‘Why not me?’ Republicans are people too.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">However, he, along with the two other openly Republican students at the school, have come under scrutiny from their peers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2"> <i>Abraham “Honest Abe” Lincoln, our first openly Republican president</i></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">“I just think it’s wrong,” said junior Jess Nichols. “I’ve always been taught that here in Lexington you’re either a Democrat or nothing at all. Who do these people think they are? These are our core community values that they’re trampling on.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">“I don’t support or condone what they’re doing,” freshman Todd Harvey said. “It’s just wrong in just so many ways. This is an erosion of American culture and values.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Despite the high numbers of students voicing their opposition to the “Republican lifestyle,” a growing minority of young people do not see a serious problem with others being Republican.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">“I mean, as long as they keep it to themselves,” senior Tina Yee said. “Like, as long as they’re not, like, wearing a Rand Paul t-shirt or saying ‘I think the federal government’s involvement in Afghanistan under the Obama administration was a disgrace, and has cost thousands of American and Afghan lives and billions of dollars.’ Like, nobody wants to hear that.”</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Fredricksen assured The Muskeeto that “the phenomenon of the open Republican at LHS” won’t fade away. “There are probably four, five, maybe even seven of us at the school alone,” he added. “A lot more than people think. Maybe even eight.””</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">At press time, the Student/Faculty Senate is considering “Politically Neutral” bathrooms for all three Republicans to use.</span></p>
